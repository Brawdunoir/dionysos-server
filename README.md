# Dionysos Server
Dionysos Server is a golang RESTful API for the [dionysos-client](https://github.com/Brawdunoir/dionysos-client) project, enabling users to **share cinematic experiences**.

# I want my own instance
If you have your own server setup and you don‚Äôt want to use the default instance address to connect with your friends, feel free to host your own dionysos server instance.

Note that your server and its ports need to be publicly accessible from your friends. We recommend using a reverse proxy such as traefik or nginx.

## Using docker üê≥
The preferred method is to run the default dionysos-server inside this repository docker image along with its database using the docker-compose inside the project.

# I want to participate üçµ
You can:
- Fill issues for enhancements or bugs, we will try to fix them asap
- Fork this repository, make code changes and create a pull request

# Just looking for the API
WIP
